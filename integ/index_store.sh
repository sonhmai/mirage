#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Bidirectional cross-language index cache interop over one Redis.
# One language points a RAM mount's index at a Redis key prefix through
# the workspace-level index config and records a listing, an empty
# listing and the entries under them; the other attaches to the same
# prefix and must read them back as the same facts (entry fields, listing
# order, "listed but empty" versus "never listed"), then invalidate and
# clear them for both. This is the one place the two stores' wire format
# is compared against each other rather than against a literal.
#
# Usage: index_store.sh
#   Requires REDIS_URL (defaults to redis://localhost:6379/0), the python
#   venv at python/.venv, and built TypeScript dists (pnpm -r build).
