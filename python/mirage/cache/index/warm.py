    """Resolve an entry when its parent listing is absent or expired.

    Id-addressed backends (Drive, Box, Dropbox, Gmail) can only turn a path
    into an id through the index, so a cold lookup has to warm it from the
    parent's listing and retry. Every such backend had grown its own copy of
    that block; this is the one place that decides what a failed listing means.

    A missing parent listing does not prove a retained entry is current: a
    partial warm may have stored the child without publishing the listing.
    Such a child is dropped before the refresh. A newly warmed child is usable
    for this lookup; without a complete parent, each lookup refreshes again.
    A parent that is simply absent is not an error here -- the caller reports
    ENOENT against the operand,
    which is the path GNU names (``rm nodir/f`` says "cannot remove 'nodir/f'",
    not "nodir"). Every other failure propagates: an expired token or a
    dropped connection reported as "no such file" both misdiagnoses the fault
    and hides that it is worth retrying.

    Args:
        index (IndexCacheStore): the index to read, and to warm through
            ``warm``.
        virtual_key (str): the index key being resolved.
        warm (Callable | None): lists the parent directory, populating the
            index; ``None`` when the key has no distinct parent to list.
