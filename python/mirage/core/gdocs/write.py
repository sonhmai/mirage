    """Append text to the end of a Google Doc, or of one of its tabs.

    A request that names no tab lands on the first one, which is
    Google's own default for every request but the three that default to
    all tabs (replaceAllText, deleteNamedRange,
    replaceNamedRangeContent). Omitting `tab_id` therefore keeps the
    first-tab behaviour rather than guessing at a better one; naming it
    is the only way to reach any other tab.

    Args:
        token_manager (TokenManager): manages OAuth2 tokens.
        doc_id (str): Google Docs document ID.
        text (str): plain text to append.
        tab_id (str | None): the tab to append to, from
            `tabs[].tabProperties.tabId`, or None for the first tab.

    Returns:
        dict: batchUpdate API response.
