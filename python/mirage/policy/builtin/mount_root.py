    Two rules, one boundary. The first mirrors the kernel's refusal to
    unlink or replace a mountpoint (EBUSY on Linux), with each command's
    own GNU message: rm, rmdir, mv, mkdir, touch and ln.

    The second is mirage's own, and is a deliberate divergence: an
    archiver or a recursive copy pointed at a mount root would read an
    entire backend into one object. Real tar and cp allow it because a
    mountpoint there is just another directory; here the mount table is
    the deployment's configuration, and consuming a whole mount is
    neither what the operand looks like it costs nor something an agent
    should be able to do to data it was merely given a view of. The
    refusal names the boundary in each tool's own voice rather than
    inventing a mirage error, so a caller sees a filesystem answer.

    Only positional operands are tested. tar's ``-C`` and unzip's ``-d``
    are destinations to extract INTO, which is ordinary use of a mount,
    so reading them here would refuse the safe direction as well.

    Fires before mount resolution and cross-mount routing so the refusal
    is the same however the operands span mounts, and before runtime
    placement so a routed command is refused identically. MountRegistry
    seeds it as the first policy (mount-root semantics belong to the
    mount layer), so its exact messages win over user policies by order,
    not by privilege.
