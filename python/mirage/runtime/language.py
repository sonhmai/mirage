class LanguageRuntime(Runtime):
    """A runtime that interprets one language's code inside a command.

    The engine inside a single command (python3, node): the workspace
    splits the line, and a captured stage's code lands here as run().
    Never the whole line; that is LineExecutorMixin's door.

    The language it interprets is declared once, for both doors: run()
    for a script CLI (runtime_for_language) and eval() for a
    config-borne policy script (evaluator_of). One attribute, because
    two would let a runtime claim python at one door and js at the
    other, and the disagreement would only surface as an unexplained
    127 or a policy evaluated on the wrong engine. Concrete runtimes
    inherit it from their language tier (PythonRuntime, JsRuntime)
    rather than declaring it per class.

    How an implementation sees workspace files is its own concern: a
    sandboxed interpreter bridges file I/O through the workspace
    dispatch attached here, while a host subprocess only sees the host
    filesystem and keeps the default no-op attach.

    The doors are the data plane (dispatch) and the name plane
    (resolver), and the list is complete on purpose: there is no
    session door. A guest reads the frozen ``RunArgs.env`` snapshot; an
    env write lands on the guest's own copy and dies with the run,
    never reaching the live session, so guest code can neither trip nor
    bypass a ``pre_session`` rule. That blindness is a security
    boundary, not a gap — a runtime that ever needs session state must
    take a gated ``SessionView``, never a bare session reference.
