    """Wrap a program so a `-c` subprocess reports the right argv[0].

    The subprocess tiers hand CPython the program through `-c`, because
    the source comes off a mount and may not exist on the host at all.
    CPython then hardcodes argv[0] to "-c" and names every frame
    "<string>", which is right for a payload and wrong for the other
    three doors: a script must see its own path in argv[0] and its own
    name in a traceback.

    Re-compiling under the real name fixes both at once, and the two
    preamble lines bind no names (`__import__` is called, not imported)
    and exec into `globals()`, which is `__main__`'s own dict, so the
    program runs in the module identity CPython would have given it.

    Deliberate divergence: the preamble is itself a frame, so a
    traceback carries one extra `File "<string>", line 2` line above
    the program's own. The frame that names the error is correct, which
    is the one that matters; removing the outer frame would mean
    catching and re-raising every exception, which would bind names in
    the program's namespace and rewrite `__context__`.

    Args:
        code (str): the program's source.
        prog (str | None): argv[0] for this run, as the source mode
            resolved it. None or "-c" means a payload, which CPython
            already reports correctly and which passes through
            untouched.
        script_cli (bool): bind the portable script-CLI globals.
        stdin (bytes | None): the CLI's input, without consuming sys.stdin.
