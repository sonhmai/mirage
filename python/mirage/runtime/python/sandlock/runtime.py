    running mirage, so they are granted only when that is also the
    interpreter about to run: adding them for a configured `home`
    would both miss that interpreter's real stdlib and hand confined
    code a read grant on mirage's own environment.

    A configured `home` whose stdlib lives outside its prefix (a
    distro-split or relocated build) needs that path listed in
    `fs_readable`; the interpreter fails loud in the dynamic loader
    rather than silently, so the omission is visible.

    The same real CPython `local` spawns — full stdlib, native wheels,
    exact `sys.flags` — but wrapped in a Landlock ruleset and a seccomp
    filter, so the code reaches only the paths the config grants. Each
    run spawns `sandlock run -r ... -w ... -- <interpreter> -c <code>`;
    the sandlock CLI is the transport, so there is no SDK dependency,
    and cancelling the run kills the child exactly as it does for the
    host interpreter.

    Reach is "process", not "vfs", and the distinction is the point:
    confinement narrows WHICH host paths the code can touch, but the
    workspace gate still never sees the I/O, so mount modes, policy,
    and accounting do not apply to it. What it buys is that a
    "process" runtime need no longer be an unbounded one — grant it a
    mirage FUSE mountpoint through `fs_writable` and the code works on
    workspace files while reaching nothing else on the host.

    The environment is NOT inherited from the mirage process. `local`
    passes os.environ straight through, which is honest for an
    explicit host escape hatch but would hand every live backend
    credential to confined code; here only the config env and the run
    env are set.

    Linux only; sandlock's own degrade options cover kernels below the
    Landlock ABI v6 its full ruleset wants.
