    backslash is lexed as more words of the operator line, so the line is
    lost from the body and, worse, lands in whatever construct was open

    an apostrophe or a ``;``. Replacing that one byte (and the byte a

    plain letter makes the scanner start the body exactly where bash
    does, without moving a single offset; the caller then reads the body
