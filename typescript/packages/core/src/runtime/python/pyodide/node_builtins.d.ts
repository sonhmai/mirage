// The three Node builtins core reaches for, declared with only the members
// it uses, rather than depending on `@types/node`.
//
// Core has to work in both runtimes, and pulling the whole Node surface in
// would let any module here use `node:fs` and still typecheck — the rule
// would survive only in review. Whatever is used has to be written down
// here first, which is a small price for a compiler-enforced boundary.
//
// Every call site is guarded twice over: a `process.versions.node` probe
// before the import, and a try/catch that degrades around it. Nothing here
// runs in a browser; these types only have to describe the Node path well
// enough to check it. `packages/node` depends on `@types/node` proper and
// is where unrestricted Node code belongs.
