 * reads fine: leading whitespace is skipped, and a line opening with a
 * backslash is lexed as more words of the operator line, so the line is
 * lost from the body and, worse, lands in whatever construct was open
 * (`tr a-z A-Z \first`), or breaks the parse outright once it holds an
 * apostrophe or a `;`. Replacing that one character (and the one a
 * backslash escapes, so `\$v` cannot surface as an expansion) with a
 * plain letter makes the scanner start the body exactly where bash does,
 * without moving a single offset; the caller then reads the body back
 * out of the untouched source. An empty line before the first kept one
 * has no character to mask without moving a row, so those are left to
 * bodyPrefix. Returns null when every body already lexes as bash reads
 * it.
