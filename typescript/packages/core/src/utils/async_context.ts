 * around. What the stack does fix is the slot's two worse failures: a
 * settle removes its own frame rather than blind-restoring a saved
 * value, so an out-of-order settle can neither wipe a binding that is
 * still live nor strand a stale one after every run has finished.
 *
 * Exported for the fallback-mode tests, which mock `createAsyncContext`
