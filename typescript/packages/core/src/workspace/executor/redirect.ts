/**
 * Handle all redirect patterns: >, >>, <, 2>, 2>&1, &>, >&2, <<<.
 *
 * File-descriptor routing follows bash's left-to-right fd table: each
 * redirect updates where fd1/fd2 point at that moment, so
 * `cmd > f 2>&1` sends both streams to f while `cmd 2>&1 > f` sends
 * stderr to the original stdout. Output files are created (and
 * truncated unless appending) when the redirect is processed, even if
 * the stream ends up empty — including the command-less `> file` form
 * (command is null).
 *
 * A redirect naming a descriptor above 2 is refused before anything opens,
 * in bash's own words for a descriptor that is not open (`3: Bad file
 * descriptor`, exit 1, the command never runs and the rest of the line
 * goes on). bash would open `3>f` itself; mirage models no descriptor
 * table, so claiming fd 3 and duplicating from it are refused alike rather
 * than silently aliased onto stdout. `>&-` closes a stream for the
 * command: its stdout is dropped and, if it wrote any, `<cmd>: write
 * error: Bad file descriptor` exits 1; a closed stdin reads as empty, a
 * documented approximation of EBADF.
 *
 * A redirect target that cannot be opened is a shell error, not a command
 * error — on both the `<` read and the `>` write side. bash reports it itself
 * and never names the command, so both paths render `<target>: <strerror>`
 * (see `redirectErrorLine`) and the rest of the line keeps running. bash also
 * stops processing redirects at the first failed open, so later targets are
 * left alone: GNU 5.2.37 answers `echo x > /nodir/f > /data/out` with one
 * message and no `/data/out`, while earlier targets keep the empty file their
 * open already created (`echo y > /data/out2 > /nodir/g` leaves `/data/out2`
 * present and empty).
 *
 * Deliberate divergence from bash: when both streams route to the same
 * destination they are concatenated stdout-then-stderr, not temporally
 * interleaved (streams are materialized buffers).
 *
 * Deliberate divergence from bash: because output files are created in a
 * second pass (after the command runs), an output redirect that precedes a
 * failing `<` is not truncated — bash processes redirects strictly left to
 * right, so `> out < missing` empties `out` before failing. `< missing >
 * out` leaves `out` uncreated on both, which is bash's behavior. For the same
 * reason a command whose `>` target is unwritable has already run here, while
 * bash fails at open time and never runs it; the write error and exit 1 are
 * reported either way.

 * `>>` is always allowed and `>|` overrides for that one redirect without
 * clearing the option. A directory reached under the option is refused
 * too, in GNU's own wording for that case rather than the noclobber one.
 * bash stops at the first target it cannot open, so the scan reports one

 *
 * The opens are modelled in the order they were written, because each one
 * is visible to the next: `set -C; echo x > a > a` creates `a` on the
 * first redirect and then refuses the second, even though `a` did not
 * exist when the statement began. Probing every target against one
 * pre-command snapshot passed both and wrote the output. `>>` and `>|`
 * never refuse but do create, so they count as opens too.
 *
 * The whole scan is skipped unless the option is on, so the ordinary
 * redirect path costs no extra round trip. That leaves
 * `> <a directory>` with the option off silently succeeding, which is a
 * separate pre-existing gap: GNU answers `Is a directory` and exit 1
 * whichever operator asked, and closing it means a stat on every output
